# Basic Hosting Setup

Hosting Stockedhome requires a machine running Docker. You'll need to install either:
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/), which is just the business logic and CLI for Docker; or
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), which is Docker Engine rolled up in a fancy UI

Each link is a docs link to their Overview page for that product. Installation instructions can be found in the sidebar and linked in the articles.
